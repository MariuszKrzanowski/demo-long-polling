# Long polling as a cure for message push mechanism
This repository contains source code to the blog article published on page https://mrmatrix.net/

## Folders structure

* `src` folder contains source codes ready to be compiled and run
* `images` folder contains `draw.io` diagrams used in article plus few screen shots. For drawing diagrams `hediet.vscode-drawio` extension was used.

## 3rd party code

For demo purpose JavaScript code based on GIST [https://gist.github.com/jfsiii/034152ecfa908cf66178](https://gist.github.com/jfsiii/034152ecfa908cf66178) is used. 
To reuse that part of code check 3rd license first. When I wrote an article I could not find any license in GIST file.
